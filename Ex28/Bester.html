At just 22, Jeff has already tested himself on peaks from Patagonia to the Himalaya. 
Born and raised in Vale Park, he carries both the energy of youth and the calm focus of a seasoned climber. 
Known for his fearless leads and easy camaraderie, Jeff quickly became a favorite among our guests. 
This season, he will be guiding ascents on the Petit Grepon and the Diamond.
