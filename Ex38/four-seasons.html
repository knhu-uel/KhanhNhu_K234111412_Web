        <span class="title">SPRING</span>
        In the days of December, when heaven and earth are bustling in the love song of the season,
        we often walk together through the crowded streets of Tết holiday. The street is fresh and
        colorful in bright colors to wait for spring to come.
        </p>

        <p id="summer">
        <span class="title">SUMMER</span>
        Summer rain comes and goes suddenly bringing cool, clear air to erase the burning summer sun.
        Memories flood back. The first rain of the season brings bountiful crops, but sometimes takes
        away the rice fields of the austere farmers.
        </p>

        <p id="autumn">
        <span class="title">AUTUMN</span>
        When autumn comes, the gentle warmth of autumn will gradually replace the sweltering summer sun.
        The coming of autumn is not only a transformation of nature, but it also brings many changes of
        the human soul: a new look, a new emotion, a new beginning.
        </p>

        <p id="winter">
        <span class="title">WINTER</span>
        Winter is the season suitable for late love. Season of mistakes and worries. The season when myrtle
        stands hard in the cold rain but cannot bloom. It is also the season to cherish the buds. Spring begins
        with the cold from the end of winter.
